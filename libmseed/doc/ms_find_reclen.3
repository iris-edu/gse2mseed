.TH MS_FIND_RECLEN 3 2004/11/22 "Libmseed API"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Search a raw Mini-SEED record for a Blockette 1000 and return the
record size.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libmseed.h>

.BI "int  \fBms_find_reclen\fP ( const char *" msrecord ", int " maxheaderlen " );"
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBms_find_reclen\fP searches the specified raw Mini-SEED record
(\fImsrecord\fP) up to \fImaxheaderlen\fP bytes for a Blockette 1000
and determines the record length.

A Mini-SEED record is, by definition, a data record that includes a
Blockette 1000.  This routine will not be able to determine the record
length of a plain SEED data record that does not include a Blockette
1000.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBms_find_reclen\fP returns the length of the Mini-SEED record in
bytes, 0 if no Blockette 1000 was found and -1 on error.

.SH SEE ALSO
\fBms_readmsr(3)\fP, \fBms_readtraces(3)\fP and \fBmsr_unpack(3)\fP.
