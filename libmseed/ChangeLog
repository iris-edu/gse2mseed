2005.117: 1.0pre3
	- Add check for the following environment variable to force
	the data encoding format when unpacking:
	UNPACK_DATA_FORMAT = data encoding format
	- Add '-e' option to msi/msrepack to specify the input data
	encoding format allowing them to work with plain data records.
	- Define _LARGEFILE_SOURCE in fileutils.c to get ftello()
	without a compiler warning on Linux.
	- Fixup swapping when byte order is forced on LE arch.

2005.116: 1.0pre2
	- Add checking for the following environment variables that
	can be used to force the byte-order for the header and data:
	PACK_HEADER_BYTEORDER = 0 or 1
	PACK_DATA_BYTEORDER = 0 or 1
	UNPACK_HEADER_BYTEORDER = 0 or 1
	UNPACK_DATA_BYTEORDER = 0 or 1
	- Change the fpos argument to ms_readmsr() to be type off_t.
	- Change the calls to ftell() in ms_readmsr() to ftello() to
	return type off_t, this is required for large file support
	where 64-bit offsets are needed.
	- Change the header byte order determination to check for
	start years between 1920 and 2020.
	- Add gcc64 target to Makefile and example/Makefile.

2005.102: 1.0pre1
	- Change msr_pack() to use a 'D' record indicator by default.
	- Cleanup examples directory.

2005.097: 0.9.9b
	- Remove '-g' from common GCCFLAGS in examples/Makefile.
	- Small update to ms_time.3 to clarify that MS_HPTIME2EPOCH
	can be used to get both a truncated integer epoch or a
	double precision epoch.

2005.093: 0.9.9a
	- Remove '-g' from common GCCFLAGS in Makefile.

2005.091: 0.9.9
	- Fix printing of Blockette 500.
	- Change macro defines to upper case macro names.
	
2005.080: 0.9.8
	- Add ms_isratetolerable() macro to perform the default
	sample rate tolerance check. Update appropriate functions.
	- Fix sample rate checking in mst_print*() functions.
	- Fix msi example code so negative min/max gaps (overlaps)
	are parsed correctly from command line.

2005.069: 0.9.7
	- Change mst_print() to mst_printtracelist() and add
	mst_printgaplist().
	- Both of the above routines now report gaps as the time
	of the first sample after the gap minus the time of the last
	sample before the gap, sample "coverage" time is no longer
	included.
	- Make mst_groupsort() sort on source->samplerate->starttime
	instead of source->starttime.
	- ms_readmsr() will now skip non-data records when doing
	record length autodetection.
	- Add ms_hptime2epoch() macro to convert hptimes to
	Unix/POSIX epoch times, integer truncation, no rounding.
	- Add macro ms_isdataindicator() which tests a character
	for a valid data record header indicator (D,R,Q,etc.)
	- Example program msi now takes -min and -max options to
	specify min and max gap/overlap to display in gap list.
	
2005.047: 0.9.6
	- Add ms_epoch2hptime() macro to convert Unix/POSIX
	epoch times to hptimes.

2005.025: 0.9.5
	- Add 'skipnotdata' flag argument to ms_readmsr() and
	ms_readtraces() and update their respective man pages.
	- Shuffle order of arguments for ms_readtraces(), no big
	deal but since the interface was changing anyway...

2005.004: 0.9.4
	- Change printing of sample rates to print higher precision
	so that small differences in rates are noticeable.
	- Change fixed section header printing of sample rate to be
	the actual calculated value using the factor and multiplier.
	- Spell check README/INSTALL files and man pages.
	- Remove WIN32 Makefiles and hooks in example sources.
	- Minor printing fixups in the example code msi.c.

2004.352: 0.9.3
	- Change ms_readmsr() to search valid record lengths up
	to 8192 bytes when auto detecting the record size.
	- Change msr_addblockette() to always add Blockette 1000s
	to the beginning of the blockette chain and others to the
	end of the blockette chain.

2004.349:
	- Fix reduction of precision when unpacking doubles.
	- Change typo in pack.c from 'Unpacking' to 'Packing'.
	- Improve printing of float/double samples in msi.

2004.342: 0.9.2
	- Add proper rounding for span calculation in msr_endtime().

2004.341 - Release version 0.9.1
