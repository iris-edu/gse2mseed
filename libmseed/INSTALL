A simple 'make' on most Unix-like systems should build the library.
If GNU gcc is available 'make gcc' can also be used.

The library requires that C99 integer types are available on the
target computer.  Specifically the int8_t, int16_t, int32_t and
and their unsigned counterpart types.  Furthermore a 64-bit signed
integer is required.

On a Win32 platform the nmake compatible Makefile.win can be used.
